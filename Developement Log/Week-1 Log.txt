Week-1 Log

Project topic: Large scale synthetic vs natural image training performance analysis.

Work done:

Searched multiple sources for dataset that has to be used for the project.
Selected GTA dataset as a part of synthetic dataset and cityscape semantic dataset as a part of the project.
Went through the annotation of the images, like what parameters have been used while annotation.
Reviewed the labeling format and confirmed that synthetic annotations are RGB color coded and Cityscapes provides RGB color coded, label IDs and color-coded masks.
Outlined the experimental methodology, planning to compare the outcome for Only synthetic images dataset, only natural images dataset and hybrid dataset.
Testing will be done on natural unseen images.
Created project GitHub repository and established the base folder structure.

what will be done in the upcoming week:
Both dataset uses different class color map, so planning a unified color-to-class-index mapping for hybrid training scenarios.
Finalizing the color mapping table.
Prepare data splitting for the training
Generate a demo python script for preliminary training.
